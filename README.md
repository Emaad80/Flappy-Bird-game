# Flappy-Bird-game
This is a simple, browser-based Flappy Bird clone developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It recreates the classic arcade game where the player controls a bird, trying to fly through an endless series of pipes without hitting them. The goal is to get the highest score by keeping the bird in the air and dodging obstacles. The game features straightforward, fun gameplay with smooth controls powered by JavaScript.

üõ†Ô∏è Built with Vanilla JS, this project demonstrates the core functionality of a browser-based game. JavaScript handles all the logic, such as the bird's movement, collision detection with the pipes, and updating the score in real-time. The game mechanics are kept simple, focusing on creating an enjoyable and responsive gaming experience without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

üé® Styling for the game is done using basic CSS, which provides a simple, clean design and ensures that the game runs smoothly in the browser. While this version of the game is not responsive, it works perfectly on standard screen sizes. The focus here is on getting the fundamental game mechanics working properly, while keeping the code lightweight and easy to understand.

üöÄ This project serves as a great introduction to game development using vanilla web technologies. It‚Äôs ideal for beginners looking to dive into JavaScript and build interactive projects from scratch. You can easily expand this game by adding new features, such as scoring enhancements, different bird characters, background music, or even integrating mobile touch controls.
